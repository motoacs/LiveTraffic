## Describe the bug
A clear and concise description of what the bug is: What's wrong?

## To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Go to '...'
2. Click on '....'

Reproducing issues with the modelling/display of live aircrafts is next to impossible. Remember, that LiveTraffic relies on live flight data from various public sources. They aren't accurate to the feet. If, however, you observe a behaviour more or less repeatedly when 'watching' live data then provide:
1. Location (preferably airport, coordinates otherwise)
2. Weekday / Time of day (scheduled flights tend to repeat at least weekly)
3. additional pattern like aircraft type, heading, altitude, flight phase...
4. A `Log.txt` file with log level (Settings/Advanced) set to 'Debug'

## Expected behavior
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.

## Screenshots
If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.

## Technical Info
 - OS: [Mac/Win/Linux]
 - X-Plane version: 
 - LiveTraffic version:

## Log.txt
Attach your `Log.txt` file, if reproducible then please reproduce with log level (Settings/Advanced) set to 'Debug' first.
